# Tech Event Schedule Website

This project is a simple, single-page website designed to display the schedule for a one-day technical conference. It's built to be fast, easy to use, and completely serverless once generated.

## Features

* **Full Day Schedule:** Displays a clean, chronological view of all talks for the event.
* **Dynamic Timings:** Automatically calculates and shows start/end times for each talk, including breaks.
* **Category Search:** Allows users to instantly filter the schedule by typing in a category (e.g., "AI", "Frontend", "DevOps").
* **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern layout that works on different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

* **Build Process:** A **Node.js script** (`build.js`) is used to compile the final HTML file from a template and a data source.
* **Frontend:** The website is a single **`index.html`** file with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks are used on the client-side to keep it lightweight.
* **Data:** Talk information is managed in a simple **`data.json`** file, making it easy to update the schedule.

## How to Use

To build and view the website locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Build the Website:**
    Run the Node.js build script from the root of the project. This will generate the `index.html` file.

    ```bash
    node build.js
    ```

2.  **Serve the File:**
    Start a simple local web server from the project's root directory to serve the generated `index.html`. If you have Python 3, you can use:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

    (For Python 2, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)

3.  **View in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure

* **`data.json`**: Contains the data for all the talks (title, speakers, category, etc.).
* **`template.html`**: The HTML skeleton for the webpage.
* **`build.js`**: The Node.js script that reads the data and template, injects the content, and generates the final `index.html`.
* **`index.html`**: The final, self-contained webpage (generated by the build script).
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files should be ignored by version control.
